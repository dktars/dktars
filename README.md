# Hi, I'm Dakota 👋

### Learning Low-Level Systems & Kernel Security

I'm just getting started in cybersecurity and systems programming.  
My long-term goal is to work in **OS / kernel security** (Linux internals, memory safety, exploit mitigation), using **C/C++ and Rust**.

---

## What I'm focused on right now
- ✅ Linux fundamentals + command line
- ✅ C programming basics (pointers, memory, data structures)
- 🔄 OS fundamentals (processes, virtual memory, syscalls)
- 🔄 Intro reversing + debugging (GDB, basic assembly)
- 🔄 Security foundations (vuln types, mitigations)

---

## What I'm building (in public)
I learn best by building and writing things down. Here’s what I’ll be working on:

- **`linux-notes`** – Notes + diagrams as I learn kernel/OS concepts  
- **`c-fundamentals`** – Small C programs to practice memory + debugging  
- **`security-labs`** – Safe local labs (overflows, UAF concepts, mitigations)  
- **`rust-systems`** – Rust experiments for safe systems programming  

*(Repos will be messy at first — the point is consistent progress.)*

---

## Goals for 2026
- Ship 3–5 solid repos that show real growth
- Get comfortable reading documentation + source code
- Reproduce at least one real vulnerability write-up in a safe lab
- Contribute a small fix or documentation update to an open-source project

---

## Tools I'm learning
- Languages: **C**, **Rust** (later: **C++**)
- OS: **Linux** (daily driver)
- Debugging: **gdb**, **strace**, **ltrace**
- VM/Labs: **QEMU / VirtualBox** (safe testing environments)
